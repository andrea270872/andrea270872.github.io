<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
Hi,
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; sorry but I don't believe in prefaces. 
<br>
Everytime I read one I get kind of confused about the book. I don't find them very informative, because the good stuff is <i>in</i> the book, and since I have not read it yet, the author cannot really tell me much, that I would undestand. A preface feels to me like a trailer for a movie: it could easily give away too much, spoil the good parts of the movie, or if it is <i>off</i>, weird, it can make me want NOT to see the movie. Anyways... I tend to skip the preface, personally, even if sometimes I might go back AFTER I've read the whole book, and check out the preface... 
<br>
So here is what I want to do for this book instead: a nice, cool conclusion, to go over what was my <i>plan</i> for the book. And the good thing about a conclusion is that YOU can follow it, because you have already finished the actual book!
</p>

<p>
I wrote this book with three main themes in mind:
<ul>
<li>Syntax VS Semantics</li>
<li>Linear combinations</li>
<li>Boxes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Syntax VS Semantics</h2>
<p>
- normal forms and transformations
<br>
- multiple ways to write the same thing
</p>

<h2>Linear combinations</h2>
<p>
I believe that a weighted sum is one the most common concept in math, but it is not usualy presented in this way, especially in elementary math courses. (Perhaps it is more evident in stuff like <i>linear algebra</i>...). An a weighted sum is also a very direct thing to "see": on a balance scale, when reasoning about money (with all the different coins to combine to reach a certain amount), even in the way the numbers are built in the decimal system.
Polynomials, one of the central pillars of school math, are a linear combination of <b>x</b> and some <i>weights</i>.
<br>
- III -> on the abacus _|_|_ -> and base 10 = 0*10^1+3*10^0
<br>
- (2*a+b)*5 + 3*b = ? ...
<br>
- 2*x+5 = 3*x-2
</p>

<h2>Boxes</h2>
<p>
It's like data: in Computer Science these things are called tuples (a general name for couples, triplets, ect.). I find that many of the properties of math things become more clear using a concrete, mechanical representation. Take geometry on paper: the ruler and the compass have their own limitations and ways of working, that helped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid">Euclid</a> <img class="face" src="faces/Euklid-from-Alexandria.jpg"></span> working out geometrical theorems.
<br>
- <span class="open_box">2</span><span class="open_box">7</span> -> abacus _|2_|7_
<br>
- <span class="label_box"><sup>a</sup><sub>3</sub></span><span class="label_box"><sup>b</sup><sub>2</sub></span><span class="label_box"><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sub>5</sub></span> = 3*a + 2*b + 5
<br>
- <span class="open_box">7</span><span class="open_box">2</span> -> <span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><sub>2</sub></span>
<br>
- |<span class="label_box"><sup>x</sup><sub>2</sub></span><span class="label_box"><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sub>5</sub></span>|<span class="label_box"><sup>x</sup><sub>3</sub></span><span class="label_box"><sup>&nbsp;</sup><sub>-2</sub></span>| &rarr; 2*x+5 = 3*x-2

The operations (involving numbers, or fractions, or linear combinatiosn) were defined on the boxes, to make them more concrete, more <i>algorithmic</i>, in the hope to better see how they work.
