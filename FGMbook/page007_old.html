<h1>Chapter 7 - Potato and potahto</h1>
<h2>Write the same thing in different ways</h2>
<!--p>
(about rewriting numbers and formulas to prove stuff)
</p-->


<p>
Consider this square: 
<div>
	<canvas id="canvas0_1"></canvas>
	<script>boxGen('canvas0_1',{size:[4,4],borders:[
		[0,0,4,4,"black",1]
	]})</script>
</div>

It is made of 4 by 4 dots. I could <i>slice</i> it up in this way:

<div>
	<canvas id="canvas1"></canvas>
	<script>boxGen('canvas1',{size:[4,4],borders:[
		[0,0,4,4,"black",1],
		[0,0,4,1,"green",3],
		[3,1,4,4,"blue",3],
		[0,1,3,4,"red",3]
	]})</script>
</div>

where the red area is a smaller, 3 by 3 square. I can see that the 4 by 4 square CONTAINS the 3 by 3, and then some dots: the green and blue strips.
I can write that in numbers as:
<div class="formula">
4<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:red;">3<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:green;">4</span> + <span style="color:blue;">3</span>
</div>
<br>Cool, but is it still true even for larger squares? 
Is this true <i>in general</i>, for a square whose side is a number <i>n</i>?
I can write that question as a math expression, and ask: is it true that
<span class="formula">
n<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:red;">(n-1)<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:green;">n</span> + <span style="color:blue;">(n-1)</span>
</span>	

for any whole number <i>n</i>?
<br>
Well... this is an equation, and both sides (to the left and right of the "=" sign) are expressions 
with the variable <i>n</i>. So I can look back at what we did in <a href="page005.html">chapter 5</a> (the one about polynomials) and <a href="page006.html">chapter 6</a> (about equations), and I should be able
to see if the two sides of the equation are THE SAME. To do that I need to calculate (AKA simplify) the right part:
<span class="formula">
	(n-1)<sup>2</sup> + n + (n-1) =
<br> (n-1)*(n-1) + 2*n -1 =
<br> n*n-1*n -1*n+1 + 2*n -1 =
<br> n<sup>2</sup> -2*n +1 + 2*n -1 = 
<br>n<sup>2</sup>
</span>	
... so it seems that left and right part of the equation are the same, hence the equation is <b>true</b>.

Try for yourself: in the playgound below, check that our equation keeps working for large values of <i>n</i>.
</p>

<p>
	<div class="playground" id="playground1"></div>
	<script src="js/007_01.js"></script>
	<script>prepare_007_01('playground1')</script>
</p>

<p>
The playground might be convincing, but trying with some values (even A LOT of values) is NOT a <b>mathematical proof</b>, and should not be enough to make me completely sure that my equation is true for any whole number <i>n</i>... Luckily, here I have already proved that it is, by calculating and showing that the two sides of the equation are equal. 
<br>
Still! Testing with numbers is a good way to get a FEELING for how this formula works, what it says about the geometry of the sliced-up square.

<!-- not sure of the following
I can also try to prove it by <i>induction</i>, which means asking 2 things:
<ol>
<li>Is the equation true for n=1 ? (the <i>base</i> case)
<li>And: If I believe that the equation is true when n has a certain value <i>k</i>, 
	<br>can I convince myself that the equation must also be true for n=k+1, which is the next value after k. This is called the <i>induction step</i>.
</ol>


The idea here is kind of straightforward: say that a new company advertizes a robot that can sweep the floor of any number of rooms of a house, at a speed of one room per hour. 
You don't believe them and decide to test the robot for yourself.
You start the robot in the first room and after one hour the floor is all clean. Great, so you know that the robot advertisement is true, at least for 1 room in 1 hour.
<br>So far so good, but how can you be sure that the robot can sweep clean n rooms in n hours, for any number n? It would take an infinite amount of rooms to test that... so not very practical.
But wait a second: you could test for your entire house (say 5 rooms) and if you get ...
<br>

With n=1 I get:
<span class="formula">
	n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + n + (n-1) &rarr; 1<sup>2</sup> = (1-1)<sup>2</sup> + 1 + (1-1) 
	&rarr;
<br>
	1 = 0 + 1 + 0   &rarr; 1 = 1 &rarr; true
</span>	
and so the equation is correct for n=1. Now I have to assume that for n=k it is also true, and see what I can say about the case when n=k+1:
<span class="formula">
	n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + n + (n-1) &rarr; k<sup>2</sup> = (k-1)<sup>2</sup> + k + (k-1)
</span>
and I'm not tying to prove that this is correct, I will just <i>believe</i> that it is. 
I will try instead to prove that the following is true:
<span class="formula">
	(k+1)<sup>2</sup> = ((k+1)-1)<sup>2</sup> + (k+1) + ((k+1)-1) 
</span>
and this last equation I obtained by our intial equation with n, simply replacing (subsitution, right?) n with (k+1) everywhere. I can write the last equation a bit better (by doing some calculations):
<span class="formula">
	(k+1)<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> + (k+1) + k
</span-->


<br><br>
Now let's look again at the 4 by 4 square, and notice that it can be sliced in other ways too. 
If I cut it like below:
<div>
	<canvas id="canvas2"></canvas>
	<script>boxGen('canvas2',{size:[4,4],borders:[
		[0,0,3,1,"green",3],
		[3,1,4,4,"green",3],
		[0,1,3,4,"red",3],
		[3,0,4,1,"blue",3],
	]})</script>
</div>	
I get a completely different equation:
<b>
4<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:red;">3<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:green;">2*3</span> + <span style="color:blue;">1</span></b>.
And in general the equation becomes:
<span class="formula">
n<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:red;">(n-1)<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:green;">2*(n-1)</span> + <span style="color:blue;">1</span>
</span>	

It does not look like the other equation, and it says something different... but I can still ask:
is the last equation <i>true</i> for any whole number <i>n</i>? Well, is it?
<br>
Again I can try to prove that it is the case, by simplifying a bit the equation:
<span class="formula">
n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + 2*(n-1) + 1 &rarr; 
<br>
n<sup>2</sup> = n<sup>2</sup>-2*n+1 + 2*n -2 + 1 &rarr;
<br>
n<sup>2</sup> = n<sup>2</sup>+1 -2 + 1 &rarr; 
<br>
n<sup>2</sup> = n<sup>2</sup> &rarr; true
</span>	
so squares of dots behave also in this way. Or if you prefer, the dimensions of a square are linked together according to this new formula. And that is true for squares of any size.
</p>

<h3>A step back from geometry</h3>
<p>
I found a couple of ways to define the area of a square (AKA <b>n<sup>2</sup></b>), using a smaller 
square (AKA <b>(n-1)<sup>2</sup></b>) and some other <i>pieces</i>.
But the two equations that I found can also be seen as general rules for re-writing the NUMBER <b>n<sup>2</sup></b>.
<br>
In fact the two equations tell me that the square of a whole number like <b>7</b> can be calculated without using <b>7*7</b> (AKA <b>7<sup>2</sup></b>), but using <b>6</b> and <b>6<sup>2</sup></b>:
<div class="formula">
	n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + n + (n-1)  &rarr; 7*7 = 6*6 + 7 + 6
<br>	
<br>n<sup>2</sup> =  (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + 2*(n-1) + 1  &rarr; 7*7 = 6*6 + 2*(6) + 1
</div><br>
both give <b>49</b> as result.
And the second formula is even cooler the first, in a way, because it never uses <b>7</b>, only <b>6</b> and <b>1</b>! One could look at these kind of rules as SHORTCUTS: it might save time to calculate the square of a number, via a smaller number.
<br>
We derived these two equations from a square of dots (AKA from some things that are true about the geometry of squares), but now we want to FORGET that, and focus on what they say about a generic number <i>n</i>, AKA the variable <i>n</i>. And with that in mind, I might ask: would the two equations keep being true also for negative values of <i>n</i>? 
<br>
Probably not, and not just because I cannot draw a square that has -3 dots on its four side; the problem is the <b>n<sup>2</sup></b> part of the formulas, and a negative number to the second power (AKA a number <i>squared</i>) becomes positive, messing up our equations.
It's worth trying with -3 for both, just to see what happens. With n=-3 the first equation becomes:
<div class="formula">
	n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + n + (n-1) &rarr; 
	<br>(-3)<sup>2</sup> = ((-3)-1)<sup>2</sup> + (-3) + ((-3)-1) &rarr; 
	<br> 9 = 9 -3 -4 &rarr; 9 = 2 &rarr; false
</div>
and since I wanted to check if my equation worked for <i>all numbers</i> (positive and negative), one bad example is enough to be sure that IT DOES NOT. It still works for all positive, whole numbers, but I have to exclude the whole numbers that are negative.

<br>
Now I can try the second equation with n=-3:
<div class="formula">
n<sup>2</sup> = (n-1)<sup>2</sup> + 2*(n-1) + 1 &rarr; 
<br>(-3)<sup>2</sup> = ((-3)-1)<sup>2</sup> + 2*((-3)-1) + 1 &rarr; 
<br> 9 = 9 + 2*(-4) + 1 &rarr;  9 = 9 -8 + 1 &rarr; 9 = 2 &rarr; false
</div>
which means also this equation works only for positive numbers, zero included.

<br><br>
So when I create my own <i>rules</i>, like 
<center><i>"<b>something</b> can be re-written as, or replaced by <b>something</b> else"</i>
</center>	
I have to be extra careful that they are <b>true</b>; and if a rule is only true in some cases, I need to be very explicit about which cases they are. Here I can be sure that 
<b>n<sup>2</b> can be replaced by <b>(n-1)<sup>2</sup>+n+(n-1)</b>, and also by 
<b>(n-1)<sup>2</sup>+2*(n-1)+1</b>, in any other math expressions, BUT only when n is a whole number equal or larger than zero.
<!--div>???
However, there is an intersting thing here: I can use numbers even when my intuition on the geometry of the squares fails.

<h2>Making stuff up</h2>
<p>
The examples of slicing squares in the previous section show one thing: it is perfectly OK to make up some weird relationship between certain numbers, and ask "is this true in general?". 
<br>
Another way to say this is that I can INVENT ways to transform a mathematical expression (again change its looks without changing what it means), and check to see if my transformation is always correct. When I'm sure that it is correct, I can use my new transformation anywhere I like, to change expressions. Sometimes I might even find a transformation that helps solving some problem (like when we defined two transformations that help solving simple equations, in <a href="">chapter 4</a>).
<br>

We have already seen that we can make up expressions using examples from geometry. Let's consider this one now: (a+b)<sup>2</sup> , where a and b are any numbers. How can I find other ways to write that expression? I can try to look at it geometrically!


I can start with a concrete example: (3+4)<sup>2</sup> which is actually 7<sup>2</sup> = 7*7 = 49. But when I read the expression it says: "add 3 to 4 and then calculate the square". The obvious way here is to first find out that 3+4 is 7, and then square it... but when I work with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> I cannot do that. Perhaps I could try to find a relation between the square of 3 and the square of 4, and the square of (3+4); that would be interesting. 
<div>
	<canvas id="canvas3"></canvas>
	<script>boxGen('canvas3',{size:[3,3],borders:[
		[0,0,3,3,"green",1],
	]})</script>
	<canvas id="canvas4"></canvas>	
	<script>boxGen('canvas4',{size:[4,4],borders:[
		[0,0,4,4,"red",1],
	]})</script>

	<canvas id="canvas5"></canvas>	
	<script>boxGen('canvas5',{size:[7,7],borders:[
		[0,0,3,3,"green",3],
		[3,3,7,7,"red",3]
	]})</script>

	&nbsp;

	<canvas id="canvas6"></canvas>	
	<script>boxGen('canvas6',{size:[7,7],borders:[
		[0,3,3,7,"blue",1],
		[3,0,7,3,"blue",1],
		[0,0,3,3,"green",3],
		[3,3,7,7,"red",3]
	]})</script>
</div>
So, here 7<sup>2</sup> contains both <span style="color:green;">3<sup>2</sup></span> and 
<span style="color:red;">4<sup>2</sup></span>, and then some more <span style="color:blue;">dots</span>. These extra dots are two rectangles with sides 3 and 4! 
<br>How can I write this into an equation? I surely can in this concrete example, and I will get:

<span class="formula">
7<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:green;">3<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:red;">4<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	2*<span style="color:blue;">3*4</span>
</span>	
and in fact 7<sup>2</sup> = 49, while 3<sup>2</sup>+4<sup>2</sup>+2*3*4 = 9+16+24 = 49 , so it works! For 3 and 4 at least.
<br>Now I can be bold and say: I'm sure it will work also in general, for any two numbers, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>! And the equations will become:
<span class="formula">
(a+b)<sup>2</sup> = <span style="color:green;">a<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	<span style="color:red;">b<sup>2</sup></span> + 
	2*<span style="color:blue;">a*b</span>
</span>	
Traditionally in math one tries to write polynomia sorted with respect to one of the variables. Here I can re-organize my expressions so that <i>a<sup>2</sup></i> comes before <i>a<sup>1</sup></i> (which is simply <i>a</i>), and <i>a</i> comes before any constant value (because a constant, like 9 for example, is also 9*1 or 9*a<sup>0</sup>). Here the equation <i>sorted</i> by <i>a</i> becomes:
<span class="formula">
(a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> +  2*a*b + b<sup>2</sup>
</span>	
which is arguably more <i>nice looking</i>, with the powers of <i>a</i> decreasing as I read from left to right, while the powers of <i>b</i> increase.

<br>
Surprisingly, this equation is true for any values of a and b, even when one or both are negative!

<span class="task">Potato & potahto. To make sure that the equation above is always true, try to get to it from another, different direction. Try using the fact that the square of (a+b) is really just (a+b) multiplied by itself. Do the multiplication, simplify... and see if you get the same as our equation based on the gemetrical properties of squares.</span> 
</p>

<h2>Transform anything</h2>
<p>
So far we were mostly interested in substituting a variable with a number. But would it make any sense to put an entire mathematical expression into a variable?
<br>
For example, I know that a+a is 2*a, for any possible value of a. But what if a is not a number, but another expression? What if a was b+c*d? Can I say (b+c*d) + (b+c*d) = 2* (b+c*d) ? I put some brackets to be sure that I don't mess up the order or the meaning of some operations... but the questions stands.
<br>
Let's see what happens calculating the expression:
<span class="formula">
(b+c*d) + (b+c*d) = b + c*d + b + c*d = 2*b + 2*c*d = 2*(b+c*d)
</span>
Yes, that's what a+a = 2*a told us from the beginning, and it is true even when a is a whole expression.

<br>
Wait, but that means also (a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> +  2*a*b + b<sup>2</sup> must be true if a and b are other expressions.
What about...? 
<ol>
<li>( egg + salt + bacon )<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>( 4*a + 3*b )<sup>2</sup> </li>
<li> 4*a<sup>2</sup> +12 +9*b<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>( (a+b)*c )<sup>2</sup> </li>
<li>( (a-a) + b )<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>( (a+b)<sup>2</sup> + (c+d)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>

<span class="task">In the next sections I'm going to solve the first three expressions in the list.
If you like to transform expressions, try to figure out 4, 5 and 6 by yourself.</span> 

</p>

<h3>- Facing ( egg + salt + bacon )<sup>2</sup></h3>
<p>
When using these equations back and forth, we are really just looking for a certain form, pattern, and then when the elements of that pattern are recognized, we can transform our expressions into others.
But... wait: this is what we said about normal forms and transformations (in <a>chapter 1</a> for example). In fact also in this case we want to change the look of things, but not their meaning, and eventually go back by reversing the transformations.
<br>
OK, how to I put 3 feet in 2 shoes? Because that's what ( egg + salt + bacon )<sup>2</sup> looks like, with respect to my equation: (a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> +  2*a*b + b<sup>2</sup>. What is <i>a</i> and what is <i>b</i>? I have three things: egg, salt and bacon!
<br>Perhaps I can cheat and group two things, and <i>pretend</i> I only had two to start with... But would it work? Let's see:
( egg + salt + bacon )<sup>2</sup>  &rarr; ( (egg+salt) + bacon )<sup>2</sup>. OK, so now it is of the form:
<span class="formula">
	( someThing + someOtherThing )<sup>2</sup>
</span>
which is promising. I can do the transformation and see where it gets me:
<span class="formula">
( <span data-bracket="a">(egg+salt)</span> + <span data-bracket="b">bacon</span> )<sup>2</sup> &rarr; a<sup>2</sup> +  2*a*b + b<sup>2</sup> 
</span><br>
and after substituting it becomse: 
<span class="formula">
	(egg+salt)<sup>2</sup> +  2*(egg+salt)*bacon + bacon<sup>2</sup>
</span>
OK, it worked! Only now I still have a square to calculate, and some other minor stuff...
<span class="formula">
	&rarr; (egg+salt)<sup>2</sup> +  2*egg*bacon+2*salt*bacon + bacon<sup>2</sup> 
</span>
And the part (egg+salt)<sup>2</sup> is just another <i>copy</i> of the same pattern, so I can use the same transformation again.
<span class="formula">
( <span data-bracket="a">egg</span> + <span data-bracket="b">salt</span> )<sup>2</sup> &rarr; a<sup>2</sup> +  2*a*b + b<sup>2</sup> &rarr; <br> 
<br>
egg<sup>2</sup> +  2*egg*salt + salt<sup>2</sup>
</span>
Putting it all together:
<span class="formula">
	(egg<sup>2</sup> +  2*egg*salt + salt<sup>2</sup>) + 2*egg*bacon + 2*salt*bacon + bacon<sup>2</sup> 
</span>
and I just have to clean it up:
<span class="formula">
	egg<sup>2</sup> + salt<sup>2</sup> + bacon<sup>2</sup> +

	2*egg*salt + 2*egg*bacon + 2*salt*bacon
</span>
Done. And it looks very <i>elegant</i>: the square of two terms (a+b) is the sum of each squared and their double product. Here we have that to square three terms (a+b+c) we have to sum their squares and their double <i>mixed</i> products. I was not expecting this. [Note: eggs and bacon really is a powerful combination!]

<br>
And even here we can make stuff up, and write:
<span class="formula">
(a+b+c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2*a*b + 2*a*c + 2*b*c
</span>
