<h1>Chapter 4 - Fractions or "lazy divisions"</h1>

<h2>I will not calculate this division!</h2>
<p>
We could do like the ancient Greeks and keep divisions <i>un-calculated</i> ... or at least keep them not solved as long as posible in our calculations.
This is known as <i>lazy evaluation</i> and it will lead us to fractions.
<br>First let's see how we can avoid calculating divisions as long as possible in a mathematical expression. Then we can give a special syntax to an un-calculated division, ... and a better name: a fraction.
</p>

<h3>Procrastinate... in a while</h3>
<p>
Let's say that I want to AVOID calculating divisions as long as possible in a mathematical expression, for example in:
<span class="formula">(10:2) + (20:2)</span>
The usual way to go is to first calculate the two divisions (in the two brackets), then add; so:
<table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
<tr><td>(10:2)</td><td> + </td><td>(20:2)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td>  </td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td></tr>
<tr><td> 5 </td><td> + </td><td> 10 </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; +</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> 15 </td><td></td></tr>
</table>
But to delay the division as much as possible, I could try to do the addition first, then the division... if I really have to. I woudl get something like:
<br>
<span style="display:inline-block;margin-left: 25em;">
<table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
<tr><td>(10:2)</td><td> + </td><td>(20:2)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; +</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> ??? </td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</span>
<br>
OK, but wait a second! How can I add to divisions, before I even calculate them?
<br>Well, I could look at what each division means: <b>10:2</b> means "take ten sheeps and divide them equally between two of my friends", and <b>20:2</b> means "take twenty sheeps and divide them equally between the same two of my friends". The two friends will get the sum of all those sheeps, divided between them. 
<br>
However you calculate this, it must be that each friend gets half of thirty sheeps, right?! But that means that: <b>(10:2) + (20:2) = (10+20):2 = 30:2</b>, and this is only the case because I am dividing my sheeps among the same two friends. It would not work for something like <b>(10:2) + (20:3)</b>. 
But back to our <i>alternative way</i> to calculate the expression:
<br>
<span style="display:inline-block;margin-left: 25em;">
<table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
<tr><td>(10:2)</td><td> + </td><td>(20:2)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; +</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> (10+20):2 = 30:2 </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> 15 </td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</span>
<br>
Nice! It does not matter in which order I do the calculations, I stil get the same result <b>15</b>. The advantage in the second case is that I have to do only one division, which is potentially a good, lazy way to go... and perhaps I could even avoid that one!
Would it be wrong to say: <b>(10:2) + (20:2) = 30:2</b> and stop there, without giving the final result as <b>15</b>? Can <b>30:2</b> be considered kind of like a number by itself? Not really, mainly because it is clear that thirty is divisible by two, so I should do better than stop here, and finish my calculation.
<br>Fine, sure. But there might be other cases where I could prefer to stop at the division, like for example <b>1:2</b>. Perhaps here it would be better to leave <b>1:2</b> as a result of some expression, instead of incomodating <b>0.5</b>, which is a broken number (see the previous <a href="page003.html">chapter</a>) and not so nice to look at anyways...
And if I decide to go this way, I need to find out what happens with I add an un-calculated division like <b>1:2</b> to a whole number, or when I multiply it by some other number or even by another un-calculated division:
<ul>
  <li> <b>(1:2) + 3</b> = ? </li>
  <li> <b>(1:2) * 3</b> = ?? </li>
  <li> <b>(1:2) * (3:4)</b> = ??? </li>
</ul>
because so far the only thing we know is that <b>(a:b) + (c:b)</b> is equal to <b>(a+c):b</b>.
</p>

<h3>The un-calculated divisions</h3>
<p>
The first puzzle was <b>(1:2) + 3</b>. Unfortunately I don't have a rule for this one, and so far I only know how to add a number to another number, and an un-calculated divisions to another, but only when they are <i>similar enough</i> (which means that both divide by the same number, like <b>10:2</b> and <b>20:2</b>). 
What can I do here? If only I could rewrite three as a division by two, then I could easily calculate the addition... So I would like to rewrite <b>3</b> as <b>something:2</b>, but there is a number like that, it is <b>6</b>. Remember our idea that in mathematics we keep going back to the fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many ways (semantics versus syntax) and <b>3</b> is actually also <b>6:2</b>, or <b>9:3</b> by the way. Following this line of thought I can say that any whole number <b>m</b> is also equal to (AKA has the same meaning as) any un-calculated division that looks like <b>(m*n):n</b>, provided that <i>n</i> is not zero, which would create problems with the division.
<br>OK, good, so the trick here could be:
<span class="formula">(1:2) + <span style="color:blue;">3</span>
  &rarr; (1:2) + <span style="color:blue;">((<span style="color:red;">3*2</span>):2)</span> 
        = (1:2) + <span style="color:blue;">(<span style="color:red;">6</span>:2)</span> </span>
</p>
and now I can use my rule for adding un-calculated divisions:
<span class="formula">(1:2) + 3 = (1:2) + (6:2) = (1+6):2 = 7:2</span>
which eventually would be <b>3.5</b>.
<br>But is this the correct result? Let's see with a <i>calculation diagrams</i>:

<table cols="2" width="100%">
  <tr><td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> + </td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td>  </td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td> 0.5 </td><td> + </td><td> 3 </td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; +</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td> 3.5 </td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
  </td>
  <td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> + </td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; +</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><div style="width:8em;">1:2+((3*2):2) = (1+6):2 = 7:2</div></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td> 3.5 </td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr>
</table>
good! So what is the rule in general?
<span class="formula">(a:b) + n = (a:b) + ((n*b):b) = (a + n*b):b </span>
with <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>n</i> being whole numbers, and possibly <i>b</i> different from zero.

<p>
The second expression <b>(1:2) * 3</b> is a bit easier, because we could try to read the multiplcation as repetition (like we did in <a href="page002.html">chapter 2</a>): 
<i>"3 times something is just something added to something added to something"</i>, 
which translates to the mathematical expression:
<span class="formula">(1:2) * 3 = (1:2) + (1:2) + (1:2)</span>
and I have a way to do additions between un-calculated divisions, two by two:
<span class="formula">(1:2) + (1:2) = (1+1):2</span>
<span class="formula">(1:2) + (1:2) + (1:2) = (1+1):2 + (1:2) = (1+1+1):2</span>
and in a more general case, with <i>n</i> being any whole number:
<span class="formula">(1:2) * n = <span data-bracket="n times">(1:2) + ... + (1:2)</span> = 
(<span data-bracket="n times">1+...+1</span>):2 = (1*n):2</span>
<br>
OK, so in general I have a rule like:
<span class="formula">(a:b) * n = (a*n):b </span>
which looks right, considering our examples so far.
<br>
Interestingly, this last rule reminds of the the inverse relation between multiplcation and division. 
Let's take for example <b>2</b>, and a division like <b>1:2</b>; if I multiply them I get <b>1</b>, because:
<span class="formula">(1:2) * 2 = (1*2):2 = 1 </span>
and this is true for any whole number (excluding zero, which works very badly with divisions). So I can write a general property of multiplcation (and division) that says:
<span class="formula">(1:n) * n = 1 </span>
for any number <i>n</i> (just not zero). 
In our example here, <i>n</i> is <b>2</b> and <b>1:n</b> is <b>0.5</b>, so in mathematical jargon I could say that the number <b>0.5</b> is the <i>inverse</i> of the number <b>2</b>, because <b>0.5 * 2 = 1</b>!
</p>

<p>
So far so good. Now, the third expression is: <b>(1:2) * (3:4)</b>. Well... I find this one very difficult to see. How can I read it so it even makes sense? And how could I rewrite it in the hope to solve it?
<br>
I might try with one of my nice calculation diagrams: on the left I do first the divisions and then the addition, and on the right I try to do the opposite...
<table cols="2" width="100%">
  <tr><td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> * </td><td>(3:4)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td>  </td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td> 0.5 </td><td> * </td><td> 0.75 </td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; *</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td> 0.375 </td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
  </td>
  <td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> * </td><td>(3:4)</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; *</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td>?</td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr>
</table>

<br>
<div style="border-width:1px;border-color:lightgray;border-style:solid none solid solid;padding-left:.5em;">
Let's stop for a second and re-consider a simpler case, for example: <b>5 * (3:4)</b>. The most direct way to calculate this is to do the division first, then the multipilcation: 
<span class="formula">5 * (3:4) = 5 * 0.75 = 3.75</span>

In fact, thanks to the properties of multiplication and division, the brackets can be taken off, and the expression should be exactly the same (AKA it should mean the same, but look different!):
<span class="formula">5 * (3:4) = 5 * 3 : 4 = (5*3) : 4 = 15:4 = 3.75</span>
which gives the same result.
So, trusting that this is true in general, I could make up a rule like this:
<span class="formula">a * (b:c) = a * b : c = (a*b):c </span>
which again is totally reasonable, remembering the properties of multiplication, and what we did before for <b>(1:2) * 3</b>, that can also be written <b>3 * (1:2)</b>.
</div>

<br>
So now that I am convinced that <b>a*(b:c) = (a*b):c</b>, I can try to use it on my expression 
<b>(1:2) * (3:4)</b>, where <i>a</i> will be the entire first bracket <b>(1:2)</b>! If I do that I should get:
<span class="formula"><span data-bracket="a">(1:2)</span> * 
              (<span data-bracket="b">3</span>:<span data-bracket="c">4</span>) = 
              ( <span data-bracket="a">(1:2)</span> 
              *<span data-bracket="b">3</span> ):<span data-bracket="c">4</span> 
</span><br>

But <b>( <span style="color:blue;">(1:2) * 3</span> ):4</b> is made of two parts: 
<span style="color:blue;"><b>(1:2) * 3</b></span> and <b>(<span style="color:blue;">smtg</span>):4</b>. The first part is a known kind of expression, <b>(a:b) * n = (a*n):b</b>, or if your prefer it is the multiplication of a whole number by an un-calculated division, so I know what to do:
<span class="formula"><span style="color:blue;">(1:2) * 3</span> = 
  <span style="color:blue;">(1*3):2</span> = 
  <span style="color:blue;">3:2</span></span>
and the second part becomes:
<span class="formula">(<span style="color:blue;">smtg</span>):4 = 
    (<span style="color:blue;">3:2</span>):4</span>
... and I'm stuck again. What is the meaning of <b>(3:2):4</b>? I'm dividing 3 by 2 and the result by 4, right?! But what does it the mean, what situation is this division of division describing?
<br>
OK, let's say I take a flock of sheeps and divide them between 2 friends. Then I take whatever each friend got and divide that among four relatives; how many sheeps will each one of the four relatives get?
<br>
Or if your prefer the "classic" cake example: take one cake, cut it in two. Then cut each half in four parts... how small is each of the resulting slices?
</p>
<p>
  <div class="playground" id="playground1"></div>
  <script src="js/004_01.js"></script>
  <script>prepare_004_01('playground1')</script>
</p>

<p>
When you think about this kind of problems for a while your will realize that surely the order in which you divide is NOT IMPORTANT, what counts is the overall effect. So dividing by <b>2</b> and then by <b>4</b> has to be the same as dividing by <b>4</b> first and by <b>2</b> later!
After all, if I divide a cake in two and each half in four, I will get <b>2*4 = 8</b> slices, and each will be one eighth of the whole cake.
<br>
And if that is true, then I can finish my calculation: <b>(3:2):4 = (3:4):2</b> and they are both equal to 
<b>3:(2*4) = 3:8</b>. And in fact all three expressions have the same result: <b>0.375</b>.
<br>So putting it all together:
<span class="formula">(1:2) * (3:4) = ( (1:2) *3 ):4 = ( (1*3):2 ):4 = 
  <br> ( 3:2 ):4 = 3:( 2*4 ) = 3:8 = 0.375</span>

Hence, the diagram becomes:
<table cols="2" width="100%">
  <tr><td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> * </td><td>(3:4)</td></tr>
    <tr><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td>  </td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td> 0.5 </td><td> * </td><td> 0.75 </td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; *</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td> 0.375 </td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
  </td>
  <td valign="top">
    <table class="centered_table" width="33%,33%,33%">
    <tr><td>(1:2)</td><td> * </td><td>(3:4)</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; *</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><div style="width:8em;">(1*3) : (2*4) = 3:8</div></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td><b>&Downarrow; :</b></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td> 0.375 </td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr>
</table>
and since the diagrams gives the same result no matter which order I follow to calculate, it should mean that the two ways are equivalent. I might be wrong, but let's try to write a general rule for these kinds of expressions:
<span class="formula">(a:b) * (c:d) = (a*c) : (b*d)</span>
which by the way looks kind of cool! Just move some of the variables and swap the operation signs... Cool. 
<br>
But can I trust that it is true for any numbers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> (eventually remembering that <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> cannot be zero)?
<br>Well, one way could be to check that it works when b and d are equal to one, because in that case we are not really dealing with divisions anymore, so we should know what to expect. Let's see:
<span class="formula">(a:1) * (c:1) = (a*c) : (1*1)</span>
in other words: <b>a*c = a*c</b> which is surely correct! Good, so our rule at least does not make mistakes when numbers are involved, instead of actualy divisions. Nice.
<br>But to build some confidence that the rule is true in general, let's play with the plaground below, change the values of <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, and see if the two ways to write the same thing always agree, which means that hopefully <b>(a:b) * (c:d)</b> will always give the same result as 
<b>(a*c) : (b*d)</b>. See if you can find a counter-example!
</p>

<p>
<span class="task">Use this playground to test the hypothesis that <b>(a:b) * (c:d) = (a*c) : (b*d)</b>
is always true.
<br>Try for example with: (10:2) * (16:4) , which is <b>5*4</b> and should give <b>20</b> no matter how you calculate it.
<br>You can also stress-test the playground, using the "random" button, to try different, randomly created
values for <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. At what point to you start believing that the rule is always true?

<h3>Too long, didn't read...</h3>
<p>
OK, that was a bit too long... What about a more direct, more visual way to understand what 
<b>(a:b) * (c:d)</b> means and how to calculate it?
<br>
Sure, we can try with geometry. First we make up a way to draw a division, as a series of regular cuts in a rectangle, then we reason on the geometry of this representation of divisions. Finally, we can try to see what happens when we multiply two of these cuts together...

For example, let's consider again: <b>(1:2) * (3:4)</b>. In particular I could take 
<span style="color:green;"><b>1:2</b></span> and draw it as half of a square (see below). Then I can draw 
<span style="color:blue;"><b>1:2</b></span> as three parts out of four, in a similar square.
<div>

</div>
Since the square is four by four, we are really looking at <b>16 * (1:2)</b> and <b>16 * (3:4)</b>, and to the right (in the figure above) the square that repesents <b>16 * (1:2) * (3:4)</b>, which looks very much like <b>16:2 = 8</b> and then <b>(8*3):4 = 24:4 = 6</b>, and in fact the blue rectangle to the right in the figure above has six dots. 
I could try to first calculate <b>16 * (3:4)</b>, and then divide by two...

    <canvas id="canvas4"></canvas>

The figure above shows the four by four square where I first calculate <b>3:4</b>, then on the remaining area I divide by two: <b>16 * (3:4) * (1:2)</b>, and I get <b>(16*3):4 = 48:4 = 12</b> and then <b>12:2 = 6</b>, and in fact the green rectangle to the right of the figure above has six dots. 

<br>
And six is just what our rule would give as a result: 
<span class="formula">(a:b) * (c:d) = (a*c) : (b*d)</span>
<span class="formula">(1:2) * (3:4) = (1*3) : (2*4) = 3:8</span>
and
<span class="formula">16 * (3:8) = (16*3) : 8 = 48:8 = 6</span>
... bingo! I think.

</p>
<h3>Enter the fraction</h3>
<p>
I know now that I can be <i>lazy</i> when calculating divisions, and instead I can use various rules to work with un-calculated divisions in my expressions as if they where numbers; I might then just have to do a single division at the end of the calculation, or not even that, if you let me call "result" a division like <b>7:2</b>.
<br>
Since an un-calculated division like <b>7:2</b> is just two numbers grouped together, I can decide to write it down as: 
<span class="open_box">7</span><span class="open_box">2</span>
and remember that what I mean is "the first number divide by the second". This <i>box notation</i> can be useful later when I want to write down the rules for working with these un-calculated divisions.
<br>
Boxes are fine, but I would like to treat something like <b>a:b</b> as a single thing, as an actual number. So why not giving this things a <i>special syntax</i>... and a better name? How about calling an un-calculated divison <i>a fraction</i>?!
<br>
OK,fine. Now: to work as if a fraction was a number, I have to define how to add, multiply (and perhaps also subtract and divide) fractions with other fractions. Luckily we just did that in this chapter, only that we did it writing fractions as un-calculated divisons. 
<br>
If I rewrite the rules we found with the syntax of fractions, I get:
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>
    <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><sub>2</sub></span> + 
    <span class="frac"><sup>20</sup><sub>2</sub></span> = 
    <span class="frac"><sup>10 + 20</sup><sub>2</sub></span> =
    <span class="frac"><sup>30</sup><sub>2</sub></span> 
    </b>
    <br>
    Using the boxes the calculation becomes: <span class="open_box">10</span><span class="open_box">2</span>+<span class="open_box">20</span><span class="open_box">2</span> =
    <span class="open_box">10+20</span><span class="open_box">2</span> =
    <span class="open_box">30</span><span class="open_box">2</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>
    <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> + 3 = 
    <span class="frac"><sup>1 + (3*2)</sup><sub>2</sub></span> = 
    <span class="frac"><sup>1 + 6</sup><sub>2</sub></span> = 
    <span class="frac"><sup>7</sup><sub>2</sub></span>

Fine, but I also have to ask the usual question: is there a <i>normal form</i> for a fraction and what are the possible transformations that would change how it looks but not what it means?
<br>
Let's start with our friend un-calculated division <b>1:2</b> and write it as a fraction: 
<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span>. What is means is: <i>"a division between two numbers, where the dividing number (at the bottom of the fraction) is <b>two times</b> as large as the number being divided (the one on the top of the fracton)"</i>.
We know that if calculated, the division <b>1:2</b> is the number <b>0.5</b>.
And putting these two things together one could ask: are the other ways to write the same fraction?
Answer: you bet!
<br>
For example <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><sub>20</sub></span> is also <b>10:20 = 0.5</b> and that means it is ALSO a way to write <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span>. Let's see a few other examples:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> ,
  <span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><sub>4</sub></span> , 
  <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><sub>6</sub></span> , 
  <span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><sub>20</sub></span> ,
  <span class="frac"><sup>0.1</sup><sub>0.2</sub></span> ,  
  <span class="frac"><sup>0.5</sup><sub>1</sub></span> ,
  <span class="frac"><sup>-1</sup><sub>-2</sub></span> ,
  <span class="frac"><sup>-2</sup><sub>-4</sub></span> , ... ,
  <span class="frac"><sup>SZ</sup><sub>SSZ</sub></span> , ...
</span>

OK, so ALL of these fractions ARE <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span>: so to be 
<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> you just need to be a fraction with some number on top and double as much at the bottom. And by "ten twentieth IS one half" here we mean: if you were to do the division, you will get the SAME result; we are talking about same meaning (semantics), even if the look (syntax) can be very different.
<br>
Sure. But can I choose one way to write <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> as "the official representative of the <i>one half</i>-ness"? That would be the normal form for that fraction.
For me a normal form should be a simple, possibly beautiful way to write something, not too weird and that kind of conveys the meaning as clearly as possible.
Here, <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> seems the simplest way to write this fraction: it has after all the smallest two numbers of all the others. Well, that is not entirely true: 
<span class="frac"><sup>0.1</sup><sub>0.2</sub></span> has smaller numbers, but... they are uglier! Mainly because of the broken numbers. So perhaps the principle here could be: the normal form of a fraction should be a fraction with the same meaning (AKA the "same" fraction), but with the two smallest possible whole numbers. That gives me simple AND beautiful (or at least "not too ugly"). 
<br>
<i>Note: surely I also need a fraction to never have the bottom number equal to zero, because a fraction
is just a lazy division, and we know from the previous chapter that dividing by zero does not make sense.</i>
<br>
OK, let's say that my definition of what a normal form is, makes sense. How do I check that a fraction is in normal form? And what can I do to bring a fraction to its normal form, in case it was not?
<br>I can go back and try to find similarities among all the ways to write <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span>. In fact they all look like:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="frac"><sup>k * 1</sup><sub>k * 2</sub></span>
</span>
for some number <i>k</i>. Let me try with some small values of <i>k</i>, to see what happens.
<br>
When <b>k=1 &rarr; <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span></b>,
when <b>k=3 &rarr; <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><sub>6</sub></span></b>, and 
when <b>k=0.1 &rarr; <span class="frac"><sup>0.1</sup><sub>0.2</sub></span></b>, and finally
when <b>k=-1 &rarr; <span class="frac"><sup>-1</sup><sub>-2</sub></span></b>.
<br>
Fine, this is an interesting property of fractions: <i>"a fraction stays the same if I multiply the top and bottom numbers by the same value"</i> (provided that value is NOT zero). And this property makes sense also looking at a fraction as a division, so no suprises there: in fact <b>1:2 = (1*5):(2*5) = 5:10 = 0.5</b>.
</p>

<p>
Moral of the story so far: "<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span>" is really the <i>name</i> of any fraction in the infinite family of fractions that are THE SAME as <b>1:2</b>. 
I can write the same fraction <span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub></span>
in infinitely many other ways, but they will all look like 
<span class="frac"><sup>k * a</sup><sub>k * b</sub></span>, for some number <i>k</i>.
</p>

<h2>Special fractions and the <i>zoom</i> transformation</h2>
<p>
I think that some fractions are special, for example: <span class="frac"><sup>5</sup><sub>1</sub></span>
is a fraction but looks suspiciously like a normal whole number. 
And in fact if I look at it as a lazy division, it must be the same as <b>5:1 = 5</b>, so a fraction with one at the bottom is a whole number. 
<br>
Good, and what about <span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><sub>2</sub></span>? Surely that is four!
But it is also fraction... not in normal form though. If I wanted to simplify this fraction, I could try to see it as something of the form: <span class="frac"><sup>k * a</sup><sub>k * b</sub></span>.
Or if you like, I can try to divide both top and bottom numbers by the same (whole) number and see if I get simpler (but still whole) values for both:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><sub>2</sub></span> &rarr; I try with 2 and get  
  <span class="frac"><sup>4</sup><sub>1</sub></span> 
</span>
and I could not go any further because four and one have no factors in common.
A different way to see this process of simplification is to rewrite top and bottom number as prime factors:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="frac"><sup>8</sup><sub>2</sub></span> &rarr; 
  <span class="frac"><sup>2*2*2</sup><sub>2</sub></span> &rarr; 
  <span class="frac"><sup>2*2</sup><sub>1</sub></span> 
</span>
and then remove common factors from the top and the bottom at the same time. 
Interestingly, that means that the simplification of a fraction stops when the two numbers (top and bottom) no longer have any common prime factors. In math they say that the two numbers are <i>co-primes</i>, or that they are <i>prime with respect to each other</i>.
<br>
So some fractions are really whole numbers, and other fractions can <i>look</i> like fractions but are really simpler fractions or even whole numbers as well.

<a class="appendix_note" href="appendixA.html#appendixA02">Proper, improper and apparent fractions</a>


Interestingly at this point we have also worked with a transformation of fractions that changes the look but leaves the meaning unchanged: 
<span class="formula">
  <span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub></span> &rarr;
  <span class="frac"><sup>k * a</sup><sub>k * b</sub></span>
</span>
where <i>k</i> is any whole number, different from zero. 
I propose to call this transformation "zoom", so I can say 
<i>"<span class="frac"><sup>10</sup><sub>20</sub></span> is the fraction <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub></span> zoomed by <b>10</b>"</i>.

<br>
An alternative way to understood fractions could be to look at them as simply pairs of numbers with some special operations associated to them. In this sense, a fraction is a pair of whole numbers 
<span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">b</span>, where <i>b</i> is never zero, that together represent a lazy division; it is OK to transform both numbers together like this:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">b</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">k*a</span><span class="open_box">k*b</span>
</span>
according to our zoom transformation, because the resulting lazy division (AKA fraction) is still the same. The normal form is when the two numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> don't have any prime factors in common (AKA when they are co-primes).
The operations that we normally do with numbers can be <i>extended</i> to work with fractions and even numbers and fractions. These operations can be written as rules that re-write fractions and numbers into a new fraction:
<span class="formula">
  <span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">b</span> +
  <span class="open_box">c</span><span class="open_box">b</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a+c</span><span class="open_box">b</span>
</span>

<span class="formula">
  <span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">b</span> *
  <span class="open_box">c</span><span class="open_box">d</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a*b</span><span class="open_box">c*d</span>
</span>

<span class="formula">
  a + <span class="open_box">b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">1</span> +
  <span class="open_box">b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a*c</span><span class="open_box">1*c</span> +
  <span class="open_box">b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a*c+b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> 
</span>

<span class="formula">
  a * <span class="open_box">b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a</span><span class="open_box">1</span> *
  <span class="open_box">b</span><span class="open_box">c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a*b</span><span class="open_box">1*c</span> &rarr;
  <span class="open_box">a*b</span><span class="open_box">c</span>
</span>

And finally, a fraction has an <i>inverse</i> of itself, for example: 
<span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub></span> is the inverse of 
<span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub></span>, becuase when I multiply the first by the second I get <b>1</b>.

<div class="task">Check that it is the case. Use the multiplication rule to calculate  
<b> <span class="frac"><sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub></span> * 
    <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup><sub>2</sub></span></b>.
</div>

Whole numbers also have inverses, and those can be written as fractions; for instance: the inverse of <b>4</b> is <b>0.25</b>, because <b>4 * 0.25 = 1</b>, but <b>0.25</b> is also 
<b><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub></span></b>, and saying "the inverse of <b>4</b> is 
<b><span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub></span></b>" is much more <i>elegant</i> and clear than using <b>0.25</b>! 
<br>
Note: zero is the only number that has no inverse.

</p>

<p>
Time to play with fractions a bit. The playground below lets you manipulate fractions, create them, add, multiply and invert them (the "1/n" operator). There is also a "simplify" operatior that will reduce a fraction to its normal form. 
<br>
You can move the fractions using drag and drop. 
If you long-press the mouse button (or your finger) on a fraction, it will show itself in a different format: the standard format is <span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub></span>, and the alternative format is with visual, based on the idea that fractions are like parts of areas.
<br>The "new" operator creates random fractions for you, and sometimes you will get whole numbers (which we have established are just fractions with one as bottom number). 
<br>The "zoom" operator does somehow the opposite of what "simplify" does: it transforms a fraction by a random number <i>k</i>, so that the input fraction <span class="frac"><sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub></span>
will come out "zoomed by k", AKA looking like <span class="frac"><sup>a*k</sup><sub>b*k</sub></span>.

<div class="task">Collect new fractions until you get a whole number and a fraction, then add them up. 
<br>Is the result in normal form? Try to simplify it and see if it was.</div>

<div class="task">Collect new fractions until you get a whole number. Clone your number, so you can have two copies of it. 
<br>Now, invert one of the copies of your number, to get a fraction like <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup><sub>your number</sub></span>, then multiply your original whole number by its inverse (the fraction). What did you get as result? Do you get <b>1</b>? Is that correct? Why?</div>

<div class="task">Get a new fraction and pass it a couple of times in the zoom operator. 
What is happening to your fraction?
<br>
Now pass the fraction in the simplify operator. Is the resulting fraction still the SAME?
(which means: is the value of the fraction unchanged by the simplify operator?)
<br>
Use long-mouse-press to change the format of your fraction, so you can see its area representation.
Try to pass your fraction in the zoom operator and then in the simplify operator, a few times.
How does the area representation change after zooming and simplifying your fraction?
