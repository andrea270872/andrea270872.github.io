What is the equivalent of reaching the same destination following 2 different paths, in 1D?
Because that is what is used in the 2D version to change the "phase" of the block, so it can reach
places that it could not in the initial phase. (phase being the relationship between position of the block
and wheather it gets ther in vertical or horizontal position).

- Having a string to define the tiles and the starting point of the blox, the users could design and play their own levels :)
- the space button should be active only when on top of the right tile (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5776231/css-javascript-style-sheet-disabled )

First: implement the editor function (done).
