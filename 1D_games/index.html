	<tr><td rowspan="3" class="blue">Tetris</td>
			<td><a href="1Dminos/1Dminos.html">1Dminos</a></td>
			<td>Tetris has shapes and rotation, here they are replaced by color or color patterns, 
				and string-like operations, as swap and reverse.</td>
	</tr><tr>
			<td><a href="1Dminos_vertical/1Dminos.html">1Dminos vertical</a></td>
			<td>Same game, but rotated. This VERTICAL version should work better on mobile phones.</td>
	
	</tr><tr>
			<td><a href="tetris1D/tetris1D.html">Tetris in 1D</a></td>
			<td>Falling colored squares instead of 2D shapes. In classic tetris the pile of falled pieces cannot be manipulated,
			here instead the reverse operation acts on it. Reversing the pile, it is possible to save a 
			falling squares for later use.</td>

	<tr><td rowspan="2">Pinball</td>
		<td><i><a href="pinball1D_A/pinball1D.html">Pinball 1D A</a></i></td>
			<td>NOT FULLY PLAYABLE.
			A 1 dimensional pinball (suggested by Søren). The Sounds are used to suggest pinball-behaviour.
			The paddle has a simple binary behavior: it is active or inactive.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><a href="pinball1D_B/pinball1D.html">Pinball 1D B</a></td>
			<td>PLAYABLE, WORK-IN-PROGRESS.
			The paddle here has acceleration and slides in and out more realistically.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td><a href="http://www.bloxorzgame.com/">Bloxorz</a></td>
		<td><a href="blox1D/Blox1D.html">Blox 1D</a></td>
			<td>This game is rendered in an artistic 1D style, and to show that a simple 1D display could still represent it,
			a pure 1D representation is also shown (in the top-right corner of the canvas).
			<br>This games has an editor, so players can experiment creating their own levels.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><td rowspan="3" class="blue">Sokoban</td>
		<td><i><a href="soko1D_A/soko1D.html">Soko1D A</a></i></td>
			<td>NOT FULLY PLAYABLE. Actions: Push + swap numbers</td>
	</tr><tr>
			<td><i><a href="soko1D_B/soko1D.html">Soko1D B</a></i></td>
			<td>NOT FULLY PLAYABLE. Actions : push + directional swap</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><a href="soko1D/soko1D.html">Soko 1D</a></td>
			<td>The game exploits foldings of the 1D levels, so that the game space is infact 1.5D.
			The game is now fairly playable and has 9 levels showing that there is some room for level design even in a 1D game.
			</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><td rowspan="2">Rogue</td>
		<td><i><a href="rogue1D/rogue1D.html">Rogue1D</a></i></td>
			<td>NOT FULLY PLAYABLE. This game has 1D visualization, but 1.5D game space.</td>
	<tr>
		<td><i><a href="rogue1D_pure1D/rogue1D_pure1D.html">Rogue1D pure1D</a></i></td>
			<td>NOT FULLY PLAYABLE. A more pure 1D version of the Rogue1D.
			This version only uses 1 coordinate for the player's position, and the rooms are modelled as a graph with doors connecting them,
			still the result is very similar to the previous attempt. Rooms are color-coded to help navigate.</td>
	</tr>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><td rowspan="3" class="blue">1D 1Button B/W games</td>
		<td><a href="1D1BBW_A/1D1B.html">1D 1B BW A</a></td>
			<td>Try to figure out how this game is played. It is very minimalistic in both rules and visualization. 
			<br>What name would you give to this game?</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><a href="1D1BBW_B/1D1B.html">1D 1B BW B</a></td>
			<td>Anoter game with only 3 B/W pixels and very simple gameplay.
			<br>What name would you give to this game?</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td><a href="1D1BBW_C/1D1B.html">1D 1B BW C</a></td>
			<td>This game is a bit more complex than the previous 2. Can you figure out its rules?
			<br>What name would you give to this game?</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr><td>Space Invaders</td>
			<td><a href="1Dinvaders/1Dinvaders.html">1Dinvaders</a></td>
			<td>This is version 0.1, so still heavily UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
			<br>The idea is to have invaders disappear and reappear in a single vertical column, 
			on top of the player's tank. The sounds are taken from the original game, the enemies should be rendered
			using the original 8bit style and the shield and player's missiles have no effect by now.
			<br><i>As an alternative, it could be interesting to have 2 columns of enemies, but only 1 is visible 
			at any given time, so the player will have to press a button (or release it) to shift from a colunm to the other.</i>

	<p>These games should work on various platforms thanks to javascript and HTML5 canvas; 
	<br>among others they should work on chrome, firefox and safari, 
	<br>as well as (perhaps in a limited way) on ipad and android devices.
	</p>
	<p>Finally, a possible implementation of these games could be using RGB LED strips - to create the ultimative xmas tree game! :D
